# My personal Youtube video and Audio Downloader
This simple app was made originally because I do not trust online youtube downloader sites, a holdover from pirating music as a kid. I also found the VLC method too tedious. 

I also want to expand its uses to help streamline my footage acquisition and preparation for creating videos. There are already free programs that can download and/or format video files but they come with a lot of other stuff I don't always need so I want to reduce the amount clicks I need.

## Functionality
- [x] Download video using a given url
- [x] Download only the audio
- [ ] Select Download destination
- [ ] Batch convert files to a selected format
